## What?

- An application that lets the user 'ping' to tell that they've done a habit for today.
- This will show a grid of all the days where each day will either lit-up or not depending on the activity done.

## Why?

- While reading the book **_Atomic Habits_** I found that generally people cannot continue habits for long because there is delayed gratification involved.
- People cannot get the instant high or instant acknowledgement because the results usually come much later.
- Atomic Habits professes that having some physical marking after performing each task will significantly increase the chance of you doing that task. (For ex; Having a jar of marble and adding one marble after each day you do the task)

## How?

- We can have a separate grid for each task (Like Github contributions)
- A simple button for "Done" that will register the task for today.

## Add a habit executor

- A habit executor can be like an alarm, which will get triggered when you're supposed to do the routine.
- It will ask: Are you doing it today?
- If the participant says no: It will ask the reason, and remind you the motivation why you started pursuing this habit.
- For ex:. I want to code daily because I want to become technical expert because I want job in Switzerland. Then whenever the app reminds me to code and I say I won't, it can show videos of life in Switzerland, dev job in Switzerland, etc ( remind me of the ultimate goal) to get rid of the inertia and get started.
- Basically guilt the user to do his daily work. Once he gets the momentum the user can hopefully grind without the app reminders.
- The habits and motivation and ultimate goals will be set by the user of course.

### Comments

- You can add something like "You've been 90% consistent with your goal(s)" (If the guy has logged for 90% of the days).
- There should be yearly/monthly/weekly view of the grids.
- Should undo today's marked action. (Done)
- Should show the current-streak for each habit
